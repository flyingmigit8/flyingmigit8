 I’m Caleb. In 2020 graduated from Conestoga with a 3 year advanced diploma in Business Administration - Management.
 Now I'm in Software Engineering Technology!
 
My interests include automation and the creation of new programs focused on helping businesses solve their problems.
 
 I’m currently learning C/C++, Java, SQL and much more. My goal is to begin collaborating on open source projects and to create my own programs to develop my skills.
