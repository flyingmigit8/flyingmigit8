 I’m Caleb. I graduated from Conestoga with a 3 year advanced diploma in Business Administration - Management.
 
My interests include automation, databse management, and the creation of new programs focused on helping businesses solve their problems.
 
 I’m currently learning C, Java, SQL, Bash scripting and much more. My goal is to begin collaborating on open source projects and to create my own programs in order to bolster my skills.
